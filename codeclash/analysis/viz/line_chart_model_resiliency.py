"""
Model Resiliency Analysis: Round-to-Round Recovery Rate by Deficit Size

This script analyzes how well different AI models recover in the immediate next round
after losing by various margins. It measures direct bounce-back ability.

Key Metrics:
- Deficit Size: Calculated per-round as (winner_score - loser_score) / (winner_score + loser_score) * 100
  This represents the losing margin as a percentage of total round outcomes.
- Recovery Success: Whether a model that lost round N wins round N+1
- Success Rate: Percentage of successful immediate recoveries for each deficit range

Visualization:
- Line chart showing deficit size (x-axis) vs next-round win rate (y-axis)
- Separate line for each model to compare resilience patterns

Insights:
- Identifies models with strong bounce-back ability vs those that struggle after losses
- Shows deficit sizes from which models can typically recover vs those that cause continued struggle
- Reveals model-specific patterns in immediate resilience and recovery
