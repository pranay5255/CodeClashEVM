Command Diversity Analysis via CDF Visualization

This script analyzes the diversity of bash commands used by different AI models
during CodeClash tournaments, visualized as a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).

WHAT THE METRIC MEASURES:
- Command Diversity = Shannon entropy of command types used in each session
- Higher entropy (2.5-3.5) = model uses many different command types
- Lower entropy (1.5-2.5) = model tends to stick to fewer command types

HOW TO INTERPRET THE CDF:
- X-axis: Shannon entropy values (diversity score)
- Y-axis: Cumulative probability (fraction of sessions at or below that diversity)
- Curves shifted RIGHT = more diverse command usage
- Curves shifted LEFT = more focused/repetitive command usage
- Steep curves = consistent behavior, gradual curves = variable behavior

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
High diversity could indicate:
- Better exploration of the codebase and problem space
- More thorough debugging and analysis approaches
- Adaptability to different types of challenges
- OR potentially inefficient trial-and-error behavior

Low diversity could indicate:
- Efficient, focused strategies with proven command patterns
- Expertise with a smaller set of reliable tools
- Consistent methodology across different problems
- OR potentially limited problem-solving approaches or tool awareness

The "best" diversity level depends on the task complexity and whether exploration
or exploitation is more valuable in the given context.
