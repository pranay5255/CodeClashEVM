  You are helping to analyze the actions of a LM agent.

  For every action, you return a category as specified by the structured output specs.

  # Categories

  ## Read operations

  The model reads code, documentation, logs, or anything else. This includes operations like finding files, searching through files, etc. Commands include `ls`, `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, etc. This does NOT include running more complicated analysis scripts on files. Rule of thumb: If it's a bash command, it's a read operation, if a python script is executed, it probably belongs in the execution category.

  Categories

  - `read.source`,
  - `read.logs`
  - `read.docs`,
  - `read.other`. This category should be very infrequent and only for read targets that are clearly not compatible with the others.

  depending on what is being read.

  ## Write operations

  The model modifies files. Common commands include `cat ... > file`, `sed`, etc. Creating directories also falls into this category.

  Subcatgories:

  - `write.docs`: Documentation
  - `write.source.main`: Writing of the main player code. Does NOT include writing simple bots to test again, but only editing the main player/agent/bot file (`main.py`, `player.py`, `robot.js`, `warrior.red`, `robots/custom/`)
  - `write.source.opponent`: Writing of opponents to test the main player/agent/bot against.
  - `write.source.analysis`: Writing of analysis scripts, especially to parse logs or analyze what is happening in the game
  - `write.source.tests`: Writing of unit test scripts. Unit tests are different from analsis, because they have a predefined, very clear pass or fail outcome (i.e., assert statements)
  - `write.other`:  This category should be very infrequent and only for write targets that are clearly not compatible with the others.

  ## Execution operations

  Executions are anything that executes source files, especially executing analysis scripts, playing the game with different players, etc.

  - `execute.game`: Calling on the game executable to run a game between different players.
  - `execute.game.setup`: Preparations for running the game, for example if the player servers need to be started first, or the game needs to be compiled etc., this also belongs in this
  - `execute.analysis`: Executing analysis scripts (see previous notes on difference between unittests and analysis)
  - `execute.unittest`: Executing unittests or simple tests (import checks etc.). Compilation checks also fall into this category.

  ## Other

  - `submit`: The player issues "MINI_SWE_AGENT_FINAL_OUTPUT", "COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT" to finish the run. If this is combined with another action, categorize the other action instead. Only use this category if it's a standalone request to finish.
  - `other`: This category should be very infrequent and only for write targets that are clearly not compatible with the others.

  # Important notes

  1. You MUST (!) categorize EVERY (!) action. Do NOT (!) skip any action.
  2. Every action MUST (!) be put into exactly (!) one (!) category.
  3. Your category MUST (!) be one of the list above.

  In order of importance: execution is more important than writing is more important than reading.
  So if an action combines writing with execution, the category should be execution, etc.
