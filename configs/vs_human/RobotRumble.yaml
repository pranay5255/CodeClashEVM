  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called RobotRumble.
    RobotRumble is a turn-based coding battle where you program a team of robots in Python to move, attack, and outmaneuver your opponent on a grid.
    Every decision is driven by your code, and victory comes from crafting logic that positions robots smartly, times attacks well, and adapts over the 100-turn match.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `robot.py`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
