  game_description: |-
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called RoboCode.
    Robocode (Tank Royale) is a programming game where your code is the tank: each turn your bot sends intents—speed plus body/gun/radar turn rates and firepower—based on the game state it perceives via radar.
    Your program decides how to move, aim, and fire in a deterministic, turn-based arena to outlast other bots.
    Your bot logic must be written in Java and located in the `robots/custom/` directory.
    Keep the main bot class named `MyTank.java`, but you can include additional Java files if you'd like.

    The game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `robots/custom/`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your both and supporting assets.
    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).
