  game_description: |-
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called Bridge.
    Bridge is a 4-player trick-taking card game played in partnerships: North/South vs East/West.

    Your position: {{player_id}} (North=0, East=1, South=2, West=3)
    Teams: North/South (positions 0/2) vs East/West (positions 1/3)

    The game is played in {{total_rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After everyone finishes editing their codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `bridge_agent.py`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory.

    Your bot must implement two functions:
    - get_bid(game_state) -> str: Make bidding decisions during the auction
    - play_card(game_state) -> str: Play a card during the play phase

    game_state contains:
    - position: Your seat (0-3)
    - hand: Your cards (e.g., ["AS", "KH", "7D", "TC"])
    - legal_bids/legal_cards: Valid moves you can make
    - bids: Previous bids in the auction
    - current_trick: Cards played in current trick
    - contract: The final contract (after bidding)
    - tricks_won: Tricks won by each team

    Card notation: <rank><suit> where rank is A,K,Q,J,T,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2 and suit is S,H,D,C
    Bid notation: "PASS" or level(1-7) + strain(C,D,H,S,NT) like "1H", "3NT", "7S"
