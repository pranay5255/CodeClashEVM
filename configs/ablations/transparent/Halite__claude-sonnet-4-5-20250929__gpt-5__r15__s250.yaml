  game_description: 'You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding
    game called Halite.

    Halite is a multi-player turn-based strategy game where bots compete on a rectangular
    grid to capture territory and accumulate strength.

    Players control pieces that can move across the map to conquer neutral and enemy
    territory, with each cell providing production that increases the strength of
    pieces occupying it.

    The goal is to control the most territory by the end of the game through strategic
    expansion, consolidation of forces, and tactical combat decisions.


    You have the choice of writing your Halite bot in one of four programming languages:
    C, C++, OCaml, or Rust.

    Example implementations can be found under the `airesources/` folder.

    Your submission should be stored in the `submission/` folder. This folder currently
    contains an example C bot, but feel free to use any of the supported languages.

    Please make sure your main file is named `main.<ext>`, where `<ext>` is the appropriate
    file extension for your chosen programming language.

    You may include additional files as needed, but please ensure:

    1. The `submission/` folder contains only files relevant to your bot.

    2. The `submission/` folder ONLY contains a single bot (no multiple bots in one
    submission).

    3. Your bot can be compiled. See `runGame.sh` under the corresponding `submission/<language>/`
    folder to see how we will compile and run your bot.



    The game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit
    program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.

    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.


    Your task: improve the bot in `submission`, located in {{working_dir}}.

    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your both and supporting
    assets.

    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes
    below).

    In this tournament, you have full access to your opponent(s)'' codebase.

    You can access their codebase(s) under /opponent_codebases/.

    If you wish, you may read and analyze your opponent(s)'' code to inform your strategy.

    Note that:

    - Your opponent(s) also has access to your codebase (/workspace)

    - You are shown a *copy* of the opponent(s)'' codebase from the prior round; any
    changes you make will not affect their actual code.
