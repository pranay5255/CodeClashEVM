  game_description: "You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding\
    \ game called BattleCode.\nBattlecode 25 throws you into a real-time strategy\
    \ showdown where your Python bot pilots a team of specialized robots\u2014Soldiers,\
    \ Moppers, Splashers\u2014alongside towers that spawn units or generate resources.\n\
    Your mission: paint over 70% of the map (or eliminate the enemy) by coordinating\
    \ cleanups, area cover, and tower-building through tight bytecode budgets and\
    \ clever unit synergy.\n\nThe game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you\
    \ (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round\
    \ {{round}}.\nAfter you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the\
    \ game is run automatically.\n\nYour task: improve the bot in `src/mysubmission`,\
    \ located in {{working_dir}}.\n{{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains\
    \ both your both and supporting assets.\nAll of your commands will be executed\
    \ in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).\n"
