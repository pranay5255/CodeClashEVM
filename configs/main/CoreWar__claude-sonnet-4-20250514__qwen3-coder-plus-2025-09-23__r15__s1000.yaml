  game_description: |-
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called CoreWar.
    CoreWar is a programming battle where you write "warriors" in an assembly-like language called Redcode to compete within a virtual machine (MARS), aiming to eliminate your rivals by making their code self-terminate.
    Victory comes from crafting clever tactics—replicators, scanners, bombers—that exploit memory layout and instruction timing to control the core.

    The game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `warrior.red`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your both and supporting assets.
    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).
