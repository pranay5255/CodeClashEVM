  game_description: "You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding\
    \ game called RoboCode.\nRobocode (Tank Royale) is a programming game where your\
    \ code is the tank: each turn your bot sends intents\u2014speed plus body/gun/radar\
    \ turn rates and firepower\u2014based on the game state it perceives via radar.\n\
    Your program decides how to move, aim, and fire in a deterministic, turn-based\
    \ arena to outlast other bots.\n\nThe game is played in 15 rounds. For every round,\
    \ you (and your competitors) edit program code that controls your bot. This is\
    \ round {{round}}.\nAfter you and your competitor finish editing your codebases,\
    \ the game is run automatically.\n\nYour task: improve the bot in `robots/custom/`,\
    \ located in {{working_dir}}.\n{{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains\
    \ both your both and supporting assets.\nAll of your commands will be executed\
    \ in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).\n"
