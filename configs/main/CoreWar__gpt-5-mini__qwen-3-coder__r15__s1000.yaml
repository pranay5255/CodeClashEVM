  game_description: "You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding\
    \ game called CoreWar.\nCoreWar is a programming battle where you write \"warriors\"\
    \ in an assembly-like language called Redcode to compete within a virtual machine\
    \ (MARS), aiming to eliminate your rivals by making their code self-terminate.\n\
    Victory comes from crafting clever tactics\u2014replicators, scanners, bombers\u2014\
    that exploit memory layout and instruction timing to control the core.\n\nThe\
    \ game is played in 15 rounds. For every round, you (and your competitors) edit\
    \ program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.\nAfter you and\
    \ your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.\n\
    \nYour task: improve the bot in `warriors/warrior.red`, located in {{working_dir}}.\n\
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your both and supporting\
    \ assets.\nAll of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory\
    \ (see notes below).\n"
