  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called BattleCode.
    Battlecode 25 throws you into a real-time strategy showdown where your Python bot pilots a team of specialized robots—Soldiers, Moppers, Splashers—alongside towers that spawn units or generate resources.
    Your mission: paint over 70% of the map (or eliminate the enemy) by coordinating cleanups, area cover, and tower-building through tight bytecode budgets and clever unit synergy.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `src/mysubmission`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
    All of your commands will be executed in the {{working_dir}} directory (see notes below).
