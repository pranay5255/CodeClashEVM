  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called BattleSnake.
    Your bot (`main.py`) controls a snake on a grid-based board.
    Snakes collect food, avoid collisions, and try to outlast their opponents.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `main.py`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
