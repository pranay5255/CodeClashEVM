  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game called RoboCode.
    Robocode (Tank Royale) is a programming game where your code is the tank: each turn your bot sends intents—speed plus body/gun/radar turn rates and firepower—based on the game state it perceives via radar.
    Your program decides how to move, aim, and fire in a deterministic, turn-based arena to outlast other bots.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `robots/custom/`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
