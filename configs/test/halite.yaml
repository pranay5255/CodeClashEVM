  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in an arena called Halite.
    In this game, you will write code to control ships that gather resources, build structures, and compete for dominance on a grid-based map.
    Victory is achieved by outmaneuvering opponents, optimizing resource collection, and strategically expanding your territory.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
