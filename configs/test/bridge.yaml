  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a Bridge coding game.

    Bridge is a 4-player trick-taking card game played in teams:
    - North/South (positions 0/2) vs East/West (positions 1/3)

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you edit your bot code (bridge_agent.py).
    After all players finish editing, games are run automatically. This is round {{round}}.

    Your bot must implement two functions:
    - get_bid(game_state) -> str: Return bid like "1H", "2NT", "PASS"
    - play_card(game_state) -> str: Return card like "AS", "7H"

    The game_state dict contains:
    - position: Your position (0=North, 1=East, 2=South, 3=West)
    - hand: List of cards in your hand
    - bids: List of previous bids
    - legal_bids: Legal bids you can make (during bidding)
    - legal_cards: Legal cards you can play (during playing)
    - current_trick: Cards played so far in current trick
    - contract: The current contract (if bidding is complete)
