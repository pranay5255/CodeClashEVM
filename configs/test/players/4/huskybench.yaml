  game_description: |
    You are a software developer ({{player_id}}) competing in a coding game for Poker.
    In this game, you will write code to control a poker-playing bot, aiming to outsmart your opponents and win chips.
    Victory comes from crafting clever strategies—bluffing, reading opponents, and managing your chip stack effectively.

    The game is played in {{rounds}} rounds. For every round, you (and your competitor) edit program code that controls your bot. This is round {{round}}.
    After you and your competitor finish editing your codebases, the game is run automatically.

    Your task: improve the bot in `warrior.red`, located in {{working_dir}}.
    {{working_dir}} is your codebase, which contains both your bot and supporting assets.
