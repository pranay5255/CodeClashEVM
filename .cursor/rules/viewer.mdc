You are building a trajectory viewer for an AI agent benchmark that pits
two AI agent in a round-based game against each other.

## Framework notes

* Write a python server using flask
* As much output as possible should be formatted uses jinja templates
* JS should be kept to a minimum
* Your input is a game folder (described below)
* Use clean modern CSS, but don't go too crazy, simplicity is key
* CSS and JS should be in separate static files, not inline in templates
* The application consists of two main pages: the viewer and the game picker

## Input folder

The input folders are all subfolders of `logs/`

The input folder has the following files

* metadata.json
* tournament.log
* rounds/$i/sim_$j.log, where $i is the round and $j is the simulation number (repetition of game)
* players/$player_id/$player_id_r$i.traj.json, where $j is the round number
* players/$player_id/player.log
* Trajectory files do not exist for the last round

Here's how a `.traj.log` file looks:


```

    "exit_status": null,
    "submission": null,
    "memory": null,
    "model_stats": {
      "instance_cost": 0.0661002,
      "api_calls": 11
    }
  },
  "messages": [

      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.\n\nYour response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).\nInclude a THOUGHT section before your command where you explain your reasoning process.\nFormat your response as shown in <format_example>.\n\n<format_example>\nYour reasoning and analysis here. Explain why you want to perform the action.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nFailure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.\nTo finish, issue the following command: `echo MINI_SWE_AGENT_FINAL_OUTPUT`\nwithout any other command."
    },

        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Please solve this issue: in gitconfig, add a new alias ldc which copies the last diff ..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT: I need to first look at the current directory to see the gitconfig file and understand its structure. Then I'll examine the existing aliases to understand the pattern and add the new 'ldc' alias that combines 'ld' (last diff) with clipboard functionality.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\ntotal 1232\ndrwxr-xr-x  ..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "THOUGHT: I can see there's a `gitconfig.sh` file in the current directory. Let me examine its contents to understand the current structure and find the existing aliases, particularly looking for the 'ld' alias and any clipboard-related aliases that I need to combine.\n\n```bash\ncat gitconfig.sh\n```"
    },
  "trajectory_format": "mini-swe-agent-1"
}
```

Here's how the metadata.json file looks like:

## Application Structure

The application has two main pages:

1. **Game Picker** (`/picker`): A hierarchical tree view of all available game sessions
2. **Trajectory Viewer** (`/`): The main viewer for a selected game session

### Navigation

* The viewer has a "Pick Game" button that navigates to the picker
* The picker shows all game sessions in a tree structure with "Open" and "Open in new tab" buttons
* Navigation between pages happens in the same tab by default

### Keyboard Shortcuts

* `p` (lowercase): Open game picker in same tab (from viewer)
* `P` (uppercase): Open game picker in new tab (from viewer)
* `Ctrl/Cmd + D`: Toggle dark/light mode
* `Ctrl/Cmd + E`: Expand all sections
* `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E`: Collapse all sections
* `Escape`: Close all open sections

### Mouse Navigation

* **Left-click**: Default action (navigate in same tab)
* **Middle-click**: Open in new tab (works on all buttons and game rows)
* **Ctrl+click or Cmd+click**: Open in new tab (alternative to middle-click)

## Game Picker Design (`/picker`)

### Features

* **Hierarchical Tree Structure**: Shows all folders recursively with proper indentation
* **Game Detection**: Any folder containing `metadata.json` is considered a game folder
* **Folder Collapse/Expand**: Click intermediate folders to minimize/expand their contents
  - Collapsed folders show 📂 icon and blue accent border
  - Expanded folders show 📁 icon
  - Children of collapsed folders are hidden
* **Visual Distinction**:
  - Game folders: 🎮 icon, clickable, blue accent color
  - Intermediate folders: 📁/📂 icon, clickable to collapse, muted appearance
* **Tree Indentation**: Uses spaces and tree characters (└─) to show folder hierarchy
* **Round Count Display**: Shows number of rounds for each game session
* **Multiple Navigation Options**:
  - Click game row: Navigate to viewer (middle-click for new tab)
  - "Open" button: Navigate to viewer (supports middle-click)
  - "↗" button: Always open viewer in new tab

### Layout

* Clean table structure with three columns: Game Session, Rounds, Action
* Responsive design that adapts to mobile screens
* Hover effects and visual feedback
* Base directory path display at the top

## Trajectory Viewer Design (`/`)

### Header

* **"Pick Game" button**: Navigate to picker (supports middle-click for new tab)
  - Shows `p` keyboard shortcut indicator
  - Tooltip explains middle-click functionality
* **"↗" button**: Always open picker in new tab
* **Dark/light mode toggle button**
* **Current folder path display** with copy functionality

### Main body

#### Overall results

* At the top, we show the content of `metadata.json`
* There's a foldout that displays main.log (hidden by default)

#### Rounds

First, show a foldout of `round_1.log`.

Then, show a foldout with the trajectory view of player 1 round 1 (see below for trajectory view)
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 1 round 1 ["submission"]
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 1 round 1 ["memory"]
Then, show a foldout with the trajectory view of player 2 round 1 (see below for trajectory view).
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 2 round 1 ["submission"]
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 2 round 1 ["memory"]

Then, show a foldout of `round_2.log`.

Then, show a foldout with the trajectory view of player 1 round 2 (see below for trajectory view)
Then, show a foldout with the trajectory view of player 2 round 2 (see below for trajectory view).
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 2 round 2 ["submission"]
Then, show a foldout with the content of trajectory player 2 round 2 ["memory"]

etc.

Note that he last round only has the `round_n.log`, but there's no more trajectories for the last one.

#### Trajectory view

This should be its own jinja template.

First show the following properties from the `info` section

* Number of LM calls (api calls)
* Cost (instance cost)

Then, show all the messages. Each message should be its own block together with the role.
Because the content can be long, make sure to have a foldout for the content.

**Message Role Badges**: Each message displays a small role badge (e.g., "User #1", "Assistant #2") in the top-right corner. These badges automatically hide on hover over the message block to improve readability and allow users to see text that might be obscured by the badge.

### Important

* Always use the player name from the metadata.json file, do not assume players are called p1, p2, etc.
